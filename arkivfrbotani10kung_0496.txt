Summary.

The old Lappish-Finnish village of Jukkasjarvi in the
parish 01 the same name is situated in the northernmost part
of Sweden in Torne Lappmark, in lat. 67Ο 50' N„ at a distance
of 17 kilometres from the great mining town of Kiruna.

The village is nearl)⁷ 300 years old, and thus the plants
brought in through the influence of man have had a consider-

in 1909 and 1910.

The district which Ι have examined covers the aforesaid
village together with the shores of the lake 01 the same name
and the slopes 01 the surrounding hills. The main part of it
lies in the pine-regimr though some points rise into the birch—
region.

Consequentlv the main part of the flora consists of species
belonging to the coniferous forests, blended‚ however, in a
considerable degree with elements belonging to the subalpine
birchforest and lastly 01 a few principallv alpine plantS. F urther
there is a rather large contingent of southern immigrants,
which owe their appearance here to their having been introduced

gradually spread into the forest-and moorland along roads
and paths.

On examining the -Jukkasjarvi flora, systematically arrang-
ed in these pages, the main part of it will appear to be sponta-
