horizonta} or oblique, with a few scales. Leaves on long
thread-like stalks without glands, pinnate with adnate,
slightly crenate pinnae, the apex broad, rounded, cremate:
texture very thing veins distinct, pinnate in the pinnae.

Found in the same locality as the seedlings ot B. ηια-
yellanz'cum.

While the seedlings of the two first-named species, which
generally are considered to be closely allied‚ resemble each
other in having entire leaves, they are in other respects very
different, especially in texture and in the length of the stein.
The third species Β. penna ‘marina is evidently a very remote
ally of the two others and probably belongs to a distinct
group, which also includes Β. spz'ccznt.

It is impossible for me to distinguish these two forms
specifically. In my Index I have referred P. Berteroanum
Hk. to D. subincisa (XVILLD.) Urban, and the specimens
seen, which correspond exactly with Hooker's description,
are apparently exindusiat-e, while the specimen referred to
D. villosa (L.) has distinct, 561056 indusia; but in other respects
the two forms fully agree. In both of them I find the costae
and especially the midribs of the pinnules beneath clothed
with many broadly ovate, broWn‚ thin scales and with spread-
ing, whitish, (leeiduous hairs3 rachis, costae and costales
densely pubes-cent above, undersurfaee finely glandular.
Lamina tripinnate-quadripinnatifid. the ultimate lobes acute.
