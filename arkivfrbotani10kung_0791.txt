THORE G. HALLE, CI OUGHTONIA, A PROBLEMATIC FOSSIL PLANT 3

ency. The veget-able tissuc. forms a thin film on the impress-
ions, and after the usual treatment the cuticles of the two sides
can be examined microscopically. There is very little differcnce
as regards the structure of the epidcrmis, between the two sides.
On one side, probably the lower one, the course of the veins is
faintly marked by rows of more elongated cells. Otherwise the
tissue is very uniform and consists of square or irregularly poly-
gonal cells. There are no stomata on either ot the two sides
(pl. 2, figs. 4 and 5).

It· is not possible to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the
real nature of these fossils. Their general habit does not sug-
gest feru-fronds. The broad, truncate base and the wrinkled
surface are characters which are not common in ferns, but more
important is the fact that the epidermis possesses no stomata.
There is no reason to believe tha-t the fronds belonged to sub-
merged parts of aquatic plants, nor can they be compared with
the filmy leaf-structures of the Hymenophyllaceae, the strong
development of the cuticles not being in accordance with such an
interpretation. The absence of stomata may therefore be taken
to indicate that the fossils do not represent ordinary green
leaves, either of ferns or of spermophytes. More probably they
are of the nature of either scale-fronds 01· some soliar organs ot'
the floral region of a spermophyte. The shape and the thin tex-
ture of the lamina appears to be more in favour of the latter view.
The fronds may be imagined to have belonged to the inflores-
cence of some highly developed gymnospermous plant, perhaps
similar to Williamsonia. It is even possible that these »bracts»
were coloured. At any rate, it is evident from the absence of
stomata that they did not perform the functions of ordinary
green leaves. Their outward resemblance to large petals such
as occur in some ot' the lower groups of the angiosperms is,
indeed, striking. This resemblance may be quite accidental
and cannot, of course, be regarded as indicating any similarity in
morphological nature; but it is evident that soliar organs which
can be suspected to have belonged to the inflorescences of the
highest gynmosperms are of very great interest. It is im-
portant, therefore, that when dealing with fossils like the pre-
sent specimens the possibility should be considered that they
may belong to the floral region.

There have been described from the Mesozoic rocks of other
districts some fossils which may be compared with the present,
