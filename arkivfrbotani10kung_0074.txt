Hymenophyllum fuciforme Sw.

The specimens from Juan Fernandez (Ξ Η. semitm-es Colla,
Meni. Ac. Torino 39: 32 tab. 61) differ from the Chilean ones
seen by me by being less divided, generally tripinnatifid, ra—
rely quadripinnatifid with broad lobes and a wing 2 mm.
broad to the rachis. This form has fully the same aspect
as H. cccuclz'culatum‚ but the sori are widely different.

Juan Fernandez: Masatierra, forest by »El Yunque»⁷
24. 8. 1908.

A much divided (quinquepinnatifid) and narrow-lobed
form with a very narrow wing to the rachis (scarcely Ἦ
mm. broad) was collected by P. DUSFJN in West-Patagonia‚
Aysen vassey, 3. 1. 1897.

Sterile specimens of H. cccudz'cidatium and H. fucijorme
are often confonnded in the herbaria3 the two species can,
however, easily be recognized by their different rhizome, which
in H. cauclz'culatum is very slender, wide-creeping and produces
leaves at large intervals, in H. j'ncijorme short, thick, almost
bulbose with subfasciculate leaves and densely clothed with

“ peculiarly looking hairs at the base of thc stipeS. They are

of a deep red colour, cylindrical with an acute point and
distinct-ly articulate by 6-10 transversa] walls. Similar hairs
are found by the base of the stipe of H. caudiculatum, but.
in this species they are much fewer and shorter.

Hymenophyllum tunbridgense (L.) Sm.

Juan Fernandez: Masafuera, by a stream, 1200 m.
27. 8. 1908.

The first sure record of this species for the islands. It
was enumerated by JoHow on the authority of PH1L1PP1 and
GAY although it was not found in the collections from the
islands known to him. The specimens were found growing
with H. cuneatum and are very typical.
