the same opinion concerning thc disposition of the sporangia
as that expressed below. This specimen and that 01 the Stock-
holm Museum form together a fairly well characterized type of
fertile leaves. It does not appear convenient to retain the widcr
and more provisional name Cladophslebis 101· these leaves, so Ι
116176 ventured to institute a ncw genus for their reception.
They appear to be identical with the Pecopteris· undans LlNDL.
δι HUTT. and the species should thus be named

Cladotheca undans L1N1)L. & HUTT. sp.

The two specimens which I have examined, agree in all
essential characters. The Stockhohn specimen is figured in pl.
1, sig. 1. It represents only a fragment of a pinna, 25 cm. long
and 2 cm. broad. The pinnules arc fairly closely set, attached
to the rachis by the whole 01 the basc. They measure about
4 mm. in breadth at the base, arc almost linear and are obtusely
pointed at the apex, The margin is 16111111γ undulating. The
specimen represents an impression 01 the lower side 01 the
pinna, and this impression is in places covered by a fairly thick
carbonaceous layer. On the surface of the coal there are seen
lines which appear to represent the secondary veins, running
from the midrib to the margin. They are slightly arched and
set on to the midrib in the same manner as are secondary 1761116.
But these lateral lines are much more marked, appearing mostly
as distinct grooves which widen towards the margin. This 16
(1116 to the fact that they mark, at the same time> the attachment
01 the sporangia which are placed on the latera] vehis, on the
lower side of the pinnules. It would appear as if the secondary
veins were simple3 but this is not certain, since what 16 66611 16
not the actual vein but thc receptacle bearing the sporangia.
A branch which bears no sporangia might therefore, if existing,
be invisible on the surface of the 0061. At any rate, no certain
traces 01 branching of the veins have been observed.

The Cambridge specimen (pl. 2, fig. l) consists 01 two pin-
nae, which 616 attached to the same side 01 6 1601116. The resem-
blance to the specimen described above is in other respects very
close. The main difference 16 that the pinnules are somewhat
shorter and broader and that the margin 16 more deeply dentate.
The pinnules are slightly retreciated ncar the base —— this is 66-
pecially evident 111 the case of the proximal margin. The vein-
