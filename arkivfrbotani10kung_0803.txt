HALLE, FRUCTIFICATIONS OE CLADOPHLEBIS DENTICULATA. 5

like lines - seen on the upper surface of the carbonaceeus layer
agree with those 01 1110 Stockholm specimen.

In places where 1110 coal has been removed both spe-
eimens show fairly clearly the arrangement and structure of the
sporangia. The following description is based mainly 011 the
Stoekholm specimen, which was the first to be examined. When
in a dry state, the specimens show only indistinet traces 01 1110
fruetificati0ns; but when the surface is moistened the sperangia
appear in sharp outlines, their yellowish to dark brown colour
contrasting vividly with the lighter tint of the rock. The best
result was obtained with Cedar-oil of the cencentration used for
anatomical preparatiens. This is a method which I have tried on
numerous different objects and found to be 01 very great use,
as the 011 causes the different shades of brown and yellew to
show out most distinctly and thereby reveals details of structure
which could not be seen before. Cedat-eil has also the great ad-
vantage that it does not soften or in any way damage the spec-i-
mens, as does water. The magnified photographs in pls. l and 2
have been taken by means 01 the binocular microseope 01 ΖΕ188,
which is indispensable in studies 01 this kind.

Corresponding to the vein-like lines on the upper surfacc
01 the carbonized pinnules, there are seen on 1110 impression of
the lower side very distinct grooves running from the midrib 10
the margin (pl. 1, figs l, 23 pl. 2, figs 1, 2). As has been remarked
above, these grooves represent no doubt the latera] veins.
The sporangia are preserved as impressions 011 which, however,
the sporangial wall has stuck like a yellow-brown coat-ing. They
are attached to the surface 01 the lateral veins along the whole or
nearly the whole of their length, from the midrib 10 1110 margin.
Thus, they appear 011 1110 impression in two rows, one 011 011011
side of the vein (pl. l, figs 3—-63 pl. 2, figs 3, 4).

The sporangia are very densely crowded, partly concealing
each ether on the impression. Their length is O.45—O.50 mm„
and the apices 01 1110 sporangia 01 each two adjacent veins touch
each other in the middle 01 the intervening segment. Conse-
quently the whole lower surface ef the pinnules is covered by
sporangia. A restored figure showing the disposition 01 the
spera-ugia is given in text-fig. l.

The sporangia are ¹sometimes seen to be provided with a
short stalk, which in 0110 01180 (pl. 2, fig.'5) 11118 a length of
