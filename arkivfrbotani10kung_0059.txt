CHRISTENSEN‚ ON SOME SPECIES OF FERNS. 9

Bleehnum magellanieum (Desv.) Mett.

Not being convinoed that 1116 South American forms of
BIechnum, which generally 316 referred 10 Β. tabulam, are
eonspecific with the genuine B. tabulare (Thbg.) from South
Africa, I prefer to name all the s')ecimens seen B. maqella-
uicum. On the other hand l am sure 11131 only one species
occurs in temperate South America; this species varies espe-
cially as to size and vestiture, but all the specimens exam-
ined are otherwise very alike. I can distinguish the following
varieties :

1. magellanieunl 16111111.

Syn. Lomaria maqellaniea Desv. Berl. Mag. 5: 330. 1811.
Large with 616111 up 10 1 1116161 high; sterile pinnae subdistant,
broadly adnate to raehis3 rachis slightly scaly above, glab-
rous beneath3 midribs of pinnae beneath sparingly floeeulose.

2. var. eyeadifolium (COLLA).

Syn. Lomaricz c-ycadijolia Colla, Mem. Ae. Torino 39: 43.

rgsana Johow. Heleehos Juan Fernandez 27.

Large3 a true treefern‚ reaching 3 height of 2 meter and
more; sterile pinnae distant, sessile with free base or slightly
adnat1e3 rachis somewhat 66311γ above‚glab1·ous beneath: mid-
ribs of pinna> densely elothed with 3 (161166 woolly 111366 6011-
sisting of loose, 111111 663166, which vary in shape from hair-
like. to broadly ovate.

Juan Fernandez: Masatierra, valle Colonial nzr 407;
22, 24. S. 1908.

Searcely different from Β. nmqellanicmz even 36 variety.
The indusium seems to be 1666 lacerato-fimbriato tha-n in
the preceding form, but it may be 311 individual character.
The fibre-lilze scales of the caudex are more rigid and 6011-
volute than in the following form.

3. var. setigerum (Gaud.).

Syn. Lomaria setiqera Gaud. Ann. 66. nat. 5: 98. 1825.

Small, 6011111361 and never arboreous; pinnae adnate, im-
brieated3 stem and 1361116 (1611661)γ 6101116(1 throughout with
