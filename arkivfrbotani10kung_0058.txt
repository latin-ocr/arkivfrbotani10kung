lense as a small pit at the top of the pustule. In the cave
CaCQ is secreted.

Although B. &hostii is very closely related to Β. attenua-
tum (Willd.) Mett„ 1 think it can be considered a distinct-
species. From B. meridense (Kl.) C. Chr„ under which name
I united in my Index the American forms generally referred
to B. attenuatum, it differs by the shape of the lamina, which
narrows gradually to both ends, upwards pinnatifid to the
very apex, downwards through a row of very short (ιβ-2 0111.)
but broad (1¹s2 0111.) auricles, which are all contiguous as
shown on COLLA's plate. The middle pinnae are closely pla-
ced, all connected at the very sligthly widened base, c. 10 cm.
long, 8—10 111111. broad. The rhizome is wide scandent (ac-
cording to ι10110111 and SKOTTSBERG) and densely clothed with
dark-brown, glossy, lanceolate scales. In the lower part of
the rachis some few appressed scales are to be found. Tex-
ture eoriaceous, the veins distinctly raised beneath. Colour
pale-green. In B. meridense the lower reduced segments are

few, distant and free, the middle ones remote and very wi- 7

dened at base, often free, and the lamina terminates in an
entire segment equal in size to the lateral ones. From ty-
pical B. alumnarum from Mascarene Islands and South Africa
Β. 801101117νῖ differs inter alia by the scales of the rhizome.

JOHOW enumerates Lomwz'a L’Hermimsserz? Bory in his list
of the feriis of Juan Fernandez, but* remarks: »Este helecho
tiene estrecha afinidad con la L. attenuata Willd. i puede tal-
vez reunirse con ella en una sola especie.» The tsypicassil West—
Indian L. L⁷Herma⁷nieri is however a distinct species, which
can not be confounded with B. attenuatmn or B. meridense.
Thus I am inclined to believe that L. L’Herminieri Johow (non
Bory) is a form of Β. Schottz‘zss.
