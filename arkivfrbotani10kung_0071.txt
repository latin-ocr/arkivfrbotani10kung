CHRISTENSEN, ox soiffl SPECIES or FERNS. 21

BAKER says (Syn. Fil. 171) that this species corresponds
very nearly with the typical Polynesian P. comans Forst. To
me it is widely different and may be distinguished by 1) its
eompound lower pinnae, 2) much shorter lobes (2-4 cm„ in
P. comans 6—10 cm.) and 3) a single row of areolos to each
side of the midrib. Certainly it is more closely related to
P. Endlicherz'ana Ag. (P. comans β Syn. Fil.)‚ from which it
differs by the characters given by AGARDH.

Pteris cretica L. Mant. 130. 1767. forma.

Falkland Islands: cultivated in XVestpoint but trans-
planted there from Hope Harbour or fro'n] the vieinity of
Sharp Peak by ΜΓ. A. Ε. FELTON.

The discovery of this cosmopolitan species in the Falk-
lands is interesting, being the southernmost locality known
till now in America. The single leaf seen resemblcs mostly
the American form of the species, but it is remarkable by
its irregularly flexuose, once or twice furcate, p el l u eid , distant
veins, deep green colour and narrow sori.

Syn. H. raram auctt. quoad plant. americ.

Under this name I unite three somewhat different forms,
which in general habit and anatomical structure arc so like
each another, that I dare not sepa-rate them specifically. It
is beyond question that H. rarum Gay, Johow, and others
belongs here, but I am also nearly sure that H. polyanthos
Johow is a form of the same species.

H. cuneatum is an intermediate between H. polyscwtlzos
or better H. scmyuinolentum and H, rarum. It resembles the
former in size and cutting, the. latter in the broad segments
and large, flat sori.
