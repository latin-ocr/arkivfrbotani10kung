18 ARKIV FoR BOTANIK. BAND 10. N:O 2.

Lamina 25—40 cm. long, 7——10 cm. broad, fully bipin-
nate3 pinnae lanceolate, ca. 4-5 cm. long, l¹l2 cm. broad,
with 5—7 pairs of free pinnules, which are obtusely toothed
or entire, rarely lobed, the upper basal ones deeply pinnatifid.
Basal scales black‚ those of the rachis pale, often hairlike‚
entire or very slightly toothed‚ deciduous and generally be-
coming white with age. Stomata large, clearly visible.

Although the larger forms of this variety look very
different from var. typicum I can not consider them specifi-
cally distinct; the var. typicum is probably an insular‚ reduced
form of the more developed P. elevans, and the var. plicatum
a still more reduced form of the same from the alpine region
of the Andes. The specimens of var. eleyon& from Skyring
resemble very much some forms of P. czwovcleatfum, from which
all forms of P. mohrioicles can be distinguished by its fleshy
texture, scaleless surfaces, thick and flat costules and by its
stomata. These are very large and slightly immersed and
are seen under a good loupe as small pits on the underside
of the lamina, which appears to have been pricked by a
needle. Such pits are not seen in P. aculeatum and P.
multifidum, and they, seem to be a good specific character
for P. molarioicles. In the var. typicum, they are less distinct.

The specimen agrees very well with the original descrip—
tion; it is evidently the. Chilean lobatum form of the collec-
tive species P. aculeatum. Rather small (25><8 cm.) and
very scaly on stem, rachis and costae beneath3 pinnae 4 cm.
long. 1 6111. broad, pinnate- in the lower half only; pinnules
broadly ovate, not auriculate, faintly toothed in the upper
half and terminating in a mucronate tooth.
