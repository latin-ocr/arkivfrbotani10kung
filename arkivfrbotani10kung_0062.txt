to be the Malayan Asplenium lonqissimum B].; from this
species our plant differs, however, in almost all characters
with the single exception of the long proliferous tail. Nei-
ther JOHOW nor SKOTTSBERG have seen fertile fronds, still
it is without question that the species belongs to the genus
Bleclmum ,ᾤ’ Lomarz'a. It is evidently a very near ally of B.
Sprucei C. Chr. (Lomaria caudata Bak.) from the Andes of
Ecuador, but as to several points the descriptions of BAKER
(Syn. Fil. 179) and SODIRO (Cr. vasc. quit. 119) do not agree
with our species, which is much larger (pinnae in B. Spucei
only 5—7 cm. ]ong) and with acuminate pinnae auricled on
both sides of the base. —- The proliferous leaf examined mea-

Dr. SKOTTSBERG has collected some secdlings of three
species of Bleclmum ,ᾇ Lomaria, which differ so much from
each other that I shall describe them shortly. Seedlings
of ferns are seldom mentioned in the literature, but it seems
that a study of them can give us some contributions to the
right understanding of the natural relation between the spe-
6163 of a genus The three species are:

1. B. maqellanicum (Desv.) Mett. var. sctiqermn (Gaud.)
—- Fig. 1 a, b. Rhizome horizontal or oblique, clothed with
thin, yellowish, ovate scales. Leaves entire, ovate-lanceolam,
acute, on long stallis, which are glandulose by stalked, capi-
tate glande. Margins crenate or undulata, texture very thin,
transparent3 veins very distinct, forked, terminating in a ca-
pitate apex within the margin. The leaf resembles very much
a barren frond of a species of Elaphoqlossum.

Found in a dark crevice on WVestpoint Island, VVcst
Falkland.

2. B. abilense (ΚΠ.) Mett. Fig. 1 c. Rhizome erect, cloth-
ed at the top with numerous brownish scales. Leaves in
rosette on short stalks, which are glandulose as in the for-
mer species, the youngest almost orbicular, the elder ones
ovate, acute, fully entire, thick, coriaceous3 veins obscure,
forked, not reaching the margin. — Chiloe'.
