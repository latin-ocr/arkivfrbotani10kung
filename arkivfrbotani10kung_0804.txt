appear oblong or obovate (pl. l, figs. 7—10). There is no trace

hiscence took place. There is sometimes seen a radial split
across the apex and continuing for some distance down, but it
is not certain that this is an original feature: it may be only an
effect of the pressure during the fossilization. The sporangia
have no annulus3 but there is a marked difference in the
cellular structure in the lower and the upper parts of each spor-
angium. The cells of the wall are often clearly seen, and in
such cases, they are found to be, in the lower part of the 5901611-
gium, thin-walled and longitudinally elongate. In the upper
part> they are shorter and pro-
vided with thick walls. This upper

01 the upper, darker zone diminish in size towards the apex, In
a few cases the latter is of a lighter colour as if occupied by some
few small thin-walled cells; but it was not possible to make
out the structure with certainty (pl. 1, 118. 9).

It was possible, by treating the carbonized remains in the
usual manner, to observe the spores microseopically (pl. 1, 1185.
ll, 12). These are rounded with a diameter 01 about 30 μ.
They have the typica] triradiate markings, but otherwise they
show no surface-sculpture of any kind. The number of spores
in each sporangium could not be made out.

Although information is still lacking 011 several important
points, the structure and arrangement of the sporangia 15 now

of these fertile leaves. In the light 01 the present evidence it
