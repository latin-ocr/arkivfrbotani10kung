suggest a Marattiaeeous affinity, which is more conspicuous, at
an)v rate, than in the case of Senstenberqia. It is, of course, im-
possible to decide whether the sporangial wall is one or more
cells thick nor in what manner the sporangia originated. It is
worthy of note, however, that the sporangia not only remain
free from each other but are sometimes even seen to be provided
with a short stalk (pl. 2, figs 4, 5). The development of the
broad apical zone of thick-walled cells is another character,
which is without parallel in the recent M arattz'aeeoe. It appears
therefore that the genus cannot be ranged within the limits of
that family as defined by its existing representatives. Yet,
there is evidently a closer relationship to the Marattiaceae than
to any one of the leptosporangiate families.

The presence of a short stalk seems to point in the direction
of the Osmundaceffl to which family there is, moreover, some
resemblance in the disposition and shape of the sporangia, and
in the appearance of the fertile pinnules. But, in Gladotheca,
the thick-walled cells form a continuous zone round the sporan-
gium, which shows that there cannot well exist any close rela-
tionship to the Osvmndaceoe.

If this zone of thick—walled cells may be at all compared with
the annulus of the leptosporangiate ferns, it 13 evidently only
among the Schizoeaceae that a somewhat analogous structure is
found. The points of resemblance in this respect have been
illustrated above by a comparison with Senjtenberqia, which
would form the connecting link with Klukia and the recent
members of the family. In Cladotheca undans, there is, however,
a more pronounced resemblance to the Marattz'aceae. It may
be that this species forms like Senstenberqz‘a a transitional stage
connecting these two families, only coming nearer to the M a·
rattmceae than does that genus.

For the present it seems to be the better plan to refrain
froin placing this plant in any definite family. It might, per-
haps, be brought under the wide heading of Prmosilices, as has
been proposed for Senftenberqz'a. It is peculiar, however, that
a fern which is evidently so little specialized and which cannot
be included in any of the existing families, occurs in so new a
formation, relatively, as the Lower Oolite.

In regard to the characters of the frond, Cladotheca undans
is very like the fern described as Pecopteris australis and referred
by RENAULT to Todea (see above). The resemblance is indeed
