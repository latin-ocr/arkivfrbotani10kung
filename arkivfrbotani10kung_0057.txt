Im my Index I referred L. Schottiz' Colla with doubt to
B. tabulam, but it is certainly identical with L. attenuata
Johow and of other authors, who have written on the ferns
of Juan Fernandez. The material collected corresponds ex—
actly with the figure of L. Schottz'z' and belongs to L. attenuata
Willd. as confined in Syn. Fil. 176. In COLLA's figure the
segments appear to be finely toothed, which by the first
glauce seems to be the case also in our specimen, but the
margins are as a fact fully entire and reflexed, while the tips
of the ¹&eins are raised on the upper surface in small acute
papillae or pustules, which protrude on the reflexed margin
and may be mistaken for teeth. JOHOW described his L. bella .·
»pinnis integerrimis, superius punctis elevati& a nervorum
extremitate formatis ornatis›>; his species is then certainly
identical with Β. Schottizss. These papillae can be found in all
the forms referred by BAKER to L. attenuata Willd. and in
other allied species, but¹ nowhere I have seen them so distinct
as in Β. Scleottz'i. They are described and figured by varss-
NIUS (Fil. Lips. 64 tab. 3 fig. 1—6, tab. 28 fig. 17—19) and
are apparently a kind of hydathodes. In the interior of the
pustule is a eave, which is surrounded by the terminal tra-
cbeids of the vascular tissue of the vein and by peculiarly
