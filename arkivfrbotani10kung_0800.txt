about their affinitics. It is generally understood that this genus
includes forms which belong to very different families and only
agree as to the outward characters of the sterile fronds. This
is confirmed by the fact that different species with the Clade-
phlebis-type of fronds have been referred to as different groups
as, for instance, the Cyathenoeoe, the Sclzffizoeaceca the Osmundaceae
and the M arattiaceae. In the first of these families is generally
placed the plant described by LINDLEY δι HUTTON¹ as N euro-
pteris arquta and more recently attributed by SEWARD² to the
genus Coniopteris. In this case the evidence is based on the
shape of the fertile segments and the presence of a cup-shaped
indusium. The structure of the sporangia is not known.

In the aspect of the sterile fronds‚ a certain resemblance to
the species just mentioned is shown by another mesozoic fem,
first described as Pecopterz's exilis PHILLIPS.³ RACIBORSK1⁴ has
brought forward additional evidence to prove that this species,
for which he instituted the genus Klukzta„ is a member of the
Shizoeaceoe‚ as had already been suggested by BUNBURY⁵ on ac-
count of the occurrence of an apical uniseriate annulus.

In the Omnumlaceoe have been placed several mesozoic ferns
with the Gladophlebis-type of frond. The one best known is
Todites Williamsom· BRGN. sp. The generic name Todites was
first employed by SEWARD in preference to Todea, which had
been previously used for this and other forms showing affinities
to the recent fern Toclea barbara. In the case of 'podices Willi-
amso'ni even the structure of the sporangia has been made known
by SOHENK⁶ and ΗΑΟΙΒΟΒΞΚΙ.7 A few more CladoplzlebiS-forms
have likewise been compared with Todea. So O. Roessaeffi, of
which ZEILLER⁸ has described fertile leaves resembling speci-
mens of Todites Williamsoni to a degree that would almost seem
to suggest specific identity. RENAULT⁹ has examined fertile
