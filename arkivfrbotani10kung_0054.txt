Hymenophyllum peltatum (Poir.) Desv. — Found by all
collectore, but Ι 6111 very inclined to believe that only
one small Hymenophgsllum, H. jallclandicmn Bak„ occurs
in the island& all specimens seen by me I refer to that
species.

3. Hymenophyllum tunbriclqense (L.) 8111. —— BAKER says (Syn.
Fil. 67, in a note under this species): »A plant from
the Falkland islands 1165 1116 pinnae only once forked,
or even simple.» This form 15 evidently the same
BAKER himself describe& 65 H. salklcmdz'cum.

4. Trzsschomanes flabellatwm (flabellula) Bory, Dup. Voy. Bot.
l: 281. 1828 —— This 15 6 very obscure plant, not found
by later 0011601015. Ι1 15 identified with T. sibtlzorpioz'des
Bory from the Mascarene Islands, thus by KUHN in
Fil. Afr„ and is he right in this, it 15 probable, that
the original specimens were not collected in the Falk-
land 151611115.1

None of the 15 species enumerated above are eudemio.
According 10 BAKER Schizaea australis Gaud. 15 6150 found
in the Auckland Islands; it 15 certainly not specifically different
from S. abilensis Phil. from 8011111 Chile and together With
11115 scarcely 10 distinguish from S. fistulosa Lab. With
exception of Ptem's cretica L.‘2 611 1116 speeies also occur in
8011111 Chile and West-Patagonia.

For several informatione, for which I 6111 due to Dr.
SKOTTSBERG‚ Ι bring him my best thanks. On my request
Professor A. G. NATHORST kindly sent me for comparison
the specimens from temperate 8011111 Α11161106 111 1116 Riks-
museum of Stockholm. Herefore Ι bring him my 111051 51110616

thanks.
