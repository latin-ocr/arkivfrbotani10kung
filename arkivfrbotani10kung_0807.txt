HALLE, FRUCTIFICATIONS OF CLADOPHLEBIS DENTICULATA. 9

30 great that SEWARD and others have advocated a specific iden-
tity. It is surprising therefore that, in the latter species, the
sporangial structure is so different that it can have led RENAULT
to refer the species to a recent genus of the Osmunclaceoe. A
new and more detailed examination of RENAULT'S species ap-
pears highly desirable. Tha-t it cannot be specifically identical
with our plant is probable alread)⁷ from the fact that the spo-
rangia are much 311131101· as compared with the size of the
pinnules. According to RENAULT'S figures they occupy only a
narrow zone on each side of the vein, whereas in our species the
two rows of sporangia completely 1111 up the 3103 between two
adJacent veins and even touch in the middle of it.

Addendum.

After the foregoing was printed, Mr. HAMSIIAW THOMAS
of Cambridge has kindly communicated to me some of the
results 01 1113 examination 01 the fertile fronds of Todites
⁴Willz'amsomss. The sporangia were found 10 differ consider-
ably from those 01 Todea and of the Osmundaceoe generally.
resembling in structure those described in the present paper.
Todzftes Willzssamsomf appears from Mr. THOMAS' results to be
the species most closely related 10 Cladotlzeca undans and it
might even be suggested that the latter should be included
in the genus Toclites. The difference in the distribution of
the sporangia may, however, constitute a sufficient ground for
a generic sepa-ration.
