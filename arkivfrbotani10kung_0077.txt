CHRISTENSEN, oi< somn SPECIES OF FERNs. 27

tuse apex, Margins of frond sinuato—cris-
pate, not plicate.
3. Η. tortuosum Hk. ἅ* Grev.
2. Valves acute, entire. Frond distinctly
plicate.
4. H. dz'chotomzmz Cav.
b. Frond plane. Valves more or less acute, den-
tato-ciliate.
5. H. maqellam'c-mn Willd.

B. Stipe wingless, pilose. Frond plane.
6. Η. dentatum Cav.

The species 3, 4 and 5 are in general habit fully identi-
cal, and it may be a question, if the differential characters
mentioned in the key can be relied upon as being of real
specific value. PHILIPPI has described three species, which
seem to connect the three species with each another. The
main characters of these forms are according to thc descrip-
tions:

Hym. Krauseanum Phil. Linnaea 30: 205.
Frond plane; valves ent-ire.
Hym. quadrifidum Phil. 1. c.
Frond plicate; valves entire, bifid.
Trichmnanes Beckeri Krause; Phil. Linnaea 33: 305.
Frond plicate3 Valves ciliato-spinose‚ receptacle much
exserted.

To the first of these I refer a specimen from Isla Huafo,
SKOTTSBERG n:r 378, 25. 7. 1908. It has the plane {rond of
H. maqellam'cum but otherwise, especially in its indusial cha-
racters, it agrees with H. (Iiclzotommn, to which species I re-
fer it as var. Krauseana (Phil.). In the mature sori the val-
ves are separated from the inflated, cup-shaped base of the
indusium. beyond which the receptacle is much protruding.
I suspect Trichomcines Beckeri Krause to be a corresponding
form either of H. dichotomum or of H. tortuosum. H. quadri-
fidum Phil.‚ which the author was inclined to consider be-
longing to a separate genus Tem-alcmona. (this name omitted
in my Index), because its quadrifid indusium, is scarcely
different from H. dichotomum, and the proposed new genus
is synonymons with Ptychophyllum Presl (see PRESL's figure.
Hym. tab. XI Β).
