CHRISTENSEN, ΟΧ SOME SPECIES OF FERNS. 25

Hymenophyllum peltatum (Poir.) Desv.

Syn. H. Wilsom‘ Hook. et auctt.

This is generally considered a common species in tempe-
rate south-Amerina, and Dr. SKoTTSBERG has collected a se·
ries of specimens from different localities, which without
more careful examination could be referred to H. pellatam.
By studying the different forms collected I have found at
least two species present, H. pellatam and H. jalklandicum
Bak„ but it must be confessed that these two species are
very closely allied, and there remains a number of small spe-
cimens which Ι have failed to determine definitely. Ι am
inclined to believe that they all belong to the latter species
if not to H. Menzz'esz'i Presl, Hym. 51, which is generally re-
ferred as a synonym to H. peltatnm. Among the specimens
I refer to H. peltatmn, the most interesting is one from

Juan Fernandez: Masafuera, heatli above 1000 m. 27.
S. 1908, as the species was hitherto unknown in the islands.

Hymenophyllum falklamlicum Bak. Syn. Fil. (38.

Syn. H. caespite-sum Christ apud DUSEN‚ Svensk Exp.
till Magellanslanderna wissensch. Ergebnisse 3: 242. 1899;
Η. ylebarz'um Christ in C. Chr. Ind. 362.

To this species I refer the majority of the small Hyme-
noplzylla collected by Dr. SKOTTSBERG. It differs from H.
peltatmn by 1) its wingless or wery slightly winged stipe and
rachis, 2) only two or more rarely three lobes to a pinna,
the margins remotely but long sinuoso-(lentate, 3) its stalked
sori with very long valve& — The rachis is commonly zig-
zag and narrowly margined above. The most· developed form
is that figured in fig. 3, a--d, but generally the leaves are much
shorter and densely caespitose. H. caespitosum Christ is such
a form growing between mosses; the pinnae therefore, become
more erect, broadest near the apex and often imbricating
each other.
