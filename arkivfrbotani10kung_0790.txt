Cloughtonia rugosa nov. gen. et sp.

F rond ovate or spatulate with obtusely pointed apex and
narrow protracted base. Margin entire. Veins bifflrcating,
radiating from the base, and the median portion of the frond.
The median portion, except in the uppermost part, more or less
strongly rugose. Epidermis on both sides similar, 016111611,1601-
angular, thick-walled cells and without stomata.

The fronds vary considerably in shape and size. In the
small specimen fig. 1, pl. 1, 1116 narrow basa] portion is very long
and protracted. Fig. 2 01 1116 same plate shows the base 01 611-
011161, larger frond3 here, too, the margins 616, 101 601116 distance,
nearly parallel. In the specimens pl. 1, figs. 4 and 5, the narrow
basa] part is short and abruptly cut 011. ΑΗ specimens agree
in the base being broad and abruptly truncate, indicating a
broad zone 01 61166111116111.01 1116 frond. The apex is more or
less pointed but not acute, and the shape varies from ovate to
spatulate. The venation is in most specimens very indistinct
and appears sinuous. In the median zone 01 1116 frond, more-
over, it is concealed by the rugosity 01 1116 surface 01 1116 161111116.
In the frond pl. 2, fig. 1, which is the specimen first discovered
by Prof. NATHORST, however, the lateral veins are clearly seen.
They are somewhat arched and divide repeatedly, the last bifurca-
tion occurring near the margin. The last marginal branches are
slightly bent forward and appear 10 1)6 connected by marginal
anastomoses — 66 111657 1)6 66611 111 pl. 2, figs. 2, 3. The character-
istic rugged aspect 01 1116 lower median portion 01 1116 frond
appears 10 be due to a wrinkling 01 1116 11661166 of the lamina,

rection, and as they are crossed over by the longitudinal me·
dian veins they appear different on the two sides 01 1116 hond,
the veins being more marked on one side (the 10117612). Τ1116

tion between veins and wrinkles is still more clearly seen.
