which all were known previously from Masatierra. JOHOW
considered 7 species· to be endemic; to this number I add
,41 Asplem'zcm stellatam, Colla, Blechnum lonqicczucla C. Chr„
ΒΖ. Schottz'z' (Colla) C. Chr. and Pterz's Berzeo-<mna Ag„ which
Ι must- accept as good species and, as far as I know, not
found elsewhere. On the other hand Bleclmzcm cycadisolium
(Colla) Sturm, registered as a species in my Index, must
be reduced to a variety of ΒΖ. mayellam'cum (Desv.) Metst.

In the Falkland Islands Dr. SKOTTSBERG has collected
13 species. of which several were not known from the islands
previously. As far as I can find the whole number of ferns
now recorded from the islands are the following 15, which
all were collected by Dr. SKOTTSBERG with the exception
of Azolla siliculo‘z'des Lam. (mayellanica Willd.) and Schz'zaea
australis Gaud.; species first found by him are marked by
an asterisk.
