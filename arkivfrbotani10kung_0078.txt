28 Aamv FoR BOTANIK. BAND 10. N:o 2.

Dr. SKOTTSBERG has discovered the true form of H. tor-
tuosum Hk. &r Grev. in the Falkland—Islands: &Vest Island,
Port Howard, nr. 86, 19. 19. 1907. The species is new to the
islands. A large form of Η. clz'clzotomum Cav. (ΞΗ. ‘niqri-
cans Colla) was collected on Juan Fernandez: Masafuera;
Quebrada de las Casas, 28. 8. 1908, and a smaller, very cris-
ped form in Masatierra: Valle Colonial, 22. 8. 1908.

H. (lentatum Cav. was on the authority of SADEBECK
(Natiirl. Pfanzenf. 14. 112) in my Index identified with H.
Bradyesz'i Hook. As shown by an authentical specimen of
H. (lentatum Cav. in Herb. swAss'rz in Stockholm this iden-
tification is right.

Serpyllopsis v. d. Β.

This genus was founded by VAN DEN 1305οΗ1 on Hyme-
nophfyllmn caespitosum Gaud. with this description: »Frons
pimiata, pinnae simplices inteqme rena simplici percarsae, sori
laterales, receptaculum incrassatmn teres», and the genus was
placed in the ‘tribe Leptocionieae, while HOOKER referred the
species to Triclzomaues because its sorus being trichomanoid,
and all later authors have followed HOOKER.

Dr. SKOTTSBERG has collected a beautiful series of spe-
cimens from different regions. After detailed studies I have
found, that the species is rather a Hymenoplayllum than a
Triclzomanes but in some respects differing from both genera.
In indusial characters it agrees best with Triclzfomanea in
habit and general appearance with Hymenophyllmn, and it is
interesting to note that two of the forms of the species were
originally described as species of Hfflnenoplcyllam. I have
arrived to the result that the species is generically different
from the. two large genera and must be referred to a separate
genus, Serpyllopsis v. d. B. The generic characters quoted
above are, however, insufficient, but Ι find two others, which
I am inclined to regard as of higher value, viz: 1) the inde-
finite growth of the leaves, and 2) the pubescence of thick,
red hairs along the rachis and midribs of pinnae beneath.

ln the figures of HOOKER (sp. fil. l: tab. 40 B) the lea-
ves are shown definite, but this was very rarely the case in
