Comnmnicated April 12th 1911 by A. G. Nunoxzsr and G. LAGERHEIM.

During a visit 10 1110 Yorkshire coast in the summer of 1910,
undertaken with assistance of the funds of »Stiftelsen Lars
Hiertas Minue», I found in the Middle Estuarine shales at Clough·
ton lVyke several specimens of a fossil plant discovered in the
same locality by Professor A. G. NATHORST in 1879. Τ110 single
specimen first found was provisiona-lly referred to by him as
Antlzrophyopsis 11. sp.‚¹ with the remark that 11 13 111 habit 1101 un-
like a szqamopter-is. 11 13 now in the Palaeobotanical Depart—
ment of the State Museum of Natural Η13101)ν at Stockholm,
where I have been able to ascertain its identity with the fossils
collected by myself last summer. The 11131 specimen had
then already some time ago been reexamined by Prof. ernoasr,
who had noted on the label that the veins do 1101 appear to anas—
tomose. This fact proved that the fossil could 1101 be an A 11111νο-
phyopsis, and the examination of my material has led me to the
opinion that it· is probably 1101 a fern-frond at all. There is no
genus of fossil plants to which the present objects could be re-
ferred, and so I have ventured 10 institute a new provisional ge-
nus for their reception, naming them after 1110 famous 10011111)ν
for fossil plants in which so far they have exclusively been found.
