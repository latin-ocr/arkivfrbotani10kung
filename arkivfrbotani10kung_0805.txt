appears that the species cannot be brought under any 01 the
existing families of the Filicineaa such as these have been defined
on the basis of living 1011115. Among fossil ferns, the nearest
analogy as regards the sporangial structure appears to bc found
in Se‘njtenberqia CORDA.¹ This Palaeozoic genus is characterized
by a pluriseriate apical annulus of thick-walled cells, which is,
however, believed by STUR to pass over gradually into the thin-
walled tissue of the lower part of the sporangium. On account
of this annulus, the specics has been referred by most authors
to the Schizoeaceoe (CORDA, 1. 0.; ZEILLER2'). STUR,³ however, has
advocated a Marattiaceous affinity‚ and SOLMs—LAUBACH,⁴
too, considers it as the best plan to include the genus in 1110
Marattiaceoe, although he admits that in so doing the limits
of that group will have to be considerably widened. Scor?
points out that Senstenberqia may perhaps be placed among the
Primosilices of ARBER“, and SEWARD⁷also remarks that it might
be a generalized type such as occur frequently 111 Palaeozoic
floras.

Although the sporangia of the present fronds may be de-
scribed as recalling in some respect those of Sentstenbcrqia yet
there is a considerable difference. In Cladotheca the upper
zone of thick-walled cells is much less distinct, passing over
gradually into the tissue of thin—walled cells in the lower part of
the sporangium, and can not bc termed an annulus. Another
point of differencc is in the arrangement of the sporangia. In
Senstenberqia these arc pla-ced singly on the lateral veins, near
the margin, i. 0. as in the recent Schizoeaceoe. In the mesozoic
fern, as described above, the sporangia are disposed in definite
sori along the lateral veins. This is a character of some import-
ance, since it distinguishes the present genus both from Sens-
tenberqia and from recent members of the Schizoeaceoe.

At the same time this disposition of the sporangia, as well
as the absence 01 a distinct and well-defined annulus, seems to
