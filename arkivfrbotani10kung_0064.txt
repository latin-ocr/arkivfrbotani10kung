from 0111100, Rio Pudem, SKOTTSBERG 16. 7. 1908. It differs
from var. Berterocma by the obtuse lobes and dense pubes-
cence of rachis and costae. FurtherI am convinced that JOHOW’s
Polgsposlz'nm mulctatum (l. c. 36 fig. 21) is only a form of
D. villosa. If I am right in this only Ι0110 species of Dryo-
pteris occurs in tlic islands, and it is interesting to note that
this species alone represents the large genus in Southern
011110, where the southern limit of the genus is found not
far south of 0111100. From the whole suban'tarctic South
America (Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Falkland Islands) no
species of Dryopteris is known. In naming the above men-
tioned forms D. villosa (L.) I agree with most authors3 however,
it must be remarked, that it is questionable, if they really
belong to the true D. villosa from the VVest Indies. Under
this name a number of forms generally are united, which
probably will prove to be good species.

Juan Fernan'dez: Masatierra, Valle Colonial, n:r 400,
22. S. 1908. This variety differs from the type (Pieris incisa
Thbg. from South Africa) and the Brazilian form (P. eleqans
Sw.) by its nearly tripinnatifid lamina with oblong tertiary
segments and by its short, often interrupted sori, which
scarcely reach above the middle of the segment.

New for the flora of Argentina. It is a very interesting
species, which resembles Asplem'um ruta mummia in a degree
that everyone would consider it a form of that species, if
it was told that the specimens were collected in Europe. It
differs only by its more glandulose fronds and exindusiate
sori. I am very inclined to believe that the two species are-
closely related, although tlicy generally are placed in two
different genera or even tribes,
