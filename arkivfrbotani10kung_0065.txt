Syn. P. australe (R. BR.) Mett. et 311611.1

var. nmgollanieum (Dsssv.)

Syn. Grammitis maqellam'ca Desv. Berl. Mag. 5: 313. 1811.

From typical P. Bz’llwdierii from Australia and New
Zealand this variety differs by 1) 1116 very 511011 stipe
(generally none). 2) the decurrent base of the lamina being
glabrous, and 3) the venation. In the type 1116. fertile
upper branch of the forked vein 15 short, not continued
beyond the sorus and 31111051 parallel to the 60513; 111 the
variety it is equal in length to the lower sterile branch and
more oblique. Otherwise the variety agrees with 1116 type,
and I therefore prefer 10 consider the American form not
being specifically distinct from P. Bz'llarclz'eriz'.

Syn. Gramme'le's nana BRACK. U. S. Expl. Exp. 16: 1. 1854.

Leaves densely caespitose, very small, 2—21‚.‘'-.› cm. long,
spathulate‚ without stem, with 2-3 thick sori near the apex;
texture thick, fleshy.

A remarkable. form, which probably 15 only a alpine
form of var. maqellcznicum, from which it differs mainly by
its small size; yet the rhizome 15 more distinctly creeping
and the spores larger.

While comparing the speciinens collected by Dr. SKo'rTS7
BERG with other specimens from America Ι found 501116
plants from lVest-Patagonia, which in size and general habit
are fully like P. Billarclierii, but in other res-pects are 50
different that I consider them specifically distinct and belon-
ging to 311 indescribed species, which I name
