series, of »new species», evidently without having knowledge
of specics from other regions with which the proposed new
ones should have been compared. Very few of PHILIPPI'S
new species will appear to be valid ones, but unfortunately
it is rather impossible to decide with certainty from his
descriptions alone, what his ›>species›> may be.

Exainining more closely the specimens collected by Dr.
SKOTTSBERG I quickly found, that not a few new observations
could be gained for the right understanding of several species,
and therefore I undertook a critical examination of the whole
material with extent use of all the literature, to which I had
access, and, continually and minutely comparing the specimens
with others of the same species from different regions, as
well as with related species. My results are laid down in
this small paper, wherein only such species are dealt with,
for which I have found new characters, or which, as I think,
were misunderstood by some authors.

Besides the new species Polypodz'um patayom'cum J here
describe two more, which, however, were known previously
but Wrongly identified with old species, viZ. the new Fuegian
Hymenoplcyllum, H. Skottsberqii, a remarkable near ally of
the tropical H. abruptum, and the curious Bleclmum lonqi-
cauda from Juan Fernandez, which was detected by JOHoW
and identified by him with the Malesian Asplenz'um Zonqissi-
mum Bl.

No new species is added to the flora of Fuegia or Southern
Chile, but not a few to the flora of Juan Fernandez and the
Falkland Islands. JoHow considered¹ 45 species as indigenous
in Juan FernandeZ. I fear that this number must be
reduced, as some of the species enumerated seem to be forms
of others also found in the islands. Dr. SKOTTSBERG has
detected three species new to the islands, viz.

C'gs-stopterz's sraqilz's (L.) Bernh.

var. canarz'ensz's (Willd.) Milde. from Masafuera

H-zsmenophyllum peltatum (Poir.) Desv. from Masafuera.

iS'erpgsllopsi-s‘ caespitosa (Gaud.) C. Chr. from both Masatierra

and Masafuera.
To these should be added Hymenoplzfsllum tunbrz‘dqense (L.)
Sin, Masafuera, which species JOHOW mentioned as doubtful
