CHRISTENSEN, ΟΝ SOME SPECIES OF FERNS. 5

Patagonia austr.-occ: Skyring, P:to Pangue‚29.4. 1908.

Falkland Islands: Saunders Islzmd, 15. 12. 1909.

This species was not found before so far south as the
Skyring WVater and is also new for the Falkland Islands. It
differs constantly from A. aethiopicum L. by its venation, the
veins running to the sinuses between the teeth of the margin.

Juan Fernandez: Masafuera, in Quebrada delas Casas
nr. 464. The leaves collected are not proliferous at, the
apeX, otherwise they agree very well with COLLA's figure:
the species is a member of the long series of forms, which
in my Index are referred to the all-comprising A. lunulatum
Sw. It is a near ally of A. pteropus KH„ but I consider it
specifically distinct. Resides the prolification itis marked
by its throughout winged stem, the wing being broadest
below, narrower upwards3 the rachis is only slightly
winged, and the pinnae deeply lobed, the lobes again cleft.

Cystoptcris fragilis (L.) BERNH.

This cosmopolitan species is quite as rich in form in
temperate South America as in Europe. The most specimens
examined belong to the subspecies sraqilis Milde, Fil. Eur.
147, thus the specimens from the Falkland Islands: Roy
Cove„ 3. 12. 1907, n:r 61.

Var. canariensis (Willd.) Milcle, Fil. Eur. 152.
