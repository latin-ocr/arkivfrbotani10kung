This 15 another new addition to the flora 01 Juan Fer-
nandez; although the specimens from both islands are sterile
I do not hesitate in referring them to this variety, Which,
however, only with difficulty and good will can be distin-
guished from f. typica. Compared with the specimens from
Falkland Islands the samples from Juan Fernandez are of a
fresh yellowish-green colour and of a very folded appearance.
