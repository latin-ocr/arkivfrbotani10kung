CHRISTENSEN, ΟΝ SOMF. SPECIES OF FERNS. 29

the hundreds 01 leaves examined by me. The leaf either ends
in a terminal sorus or more frequently in a very hairy bud,
by mean of which the leaf is long-living and capable 01
surviving an unfavorable season. —- The hairs are very un-
like those otherwise found in species 01 Hymenoplzyllaceae.
They are very thick, red, cylindrical, consisting 01 two, ra-
rely three cells, and are confined to the rachis and midribs
beneat-h.

The morphology of this little plant has been misunder-
stood by Dr. CHRIST, who (Farnkr. d. Erde 23) describes the
leaves as simple, sessile, in two rows on a axis, which is a
branch 01 1119 creeping 1111101111 stem. This interpretation is
wrong. CHRIST’s leaf-bearing, lateral branches are not stems
but leaves, which are pinnate with entire pinnae and some-
times bearing a sorus at the very apex 011119 midrib. If
CHRIST's interpretation was the right one, this terminal sorus
should be produced by a 519111 or at least a termina] leaf
altered in a sorus; but sori-producing stems and termina]
leaves are unknown. In some few cases I find the leaves
definite, ending in a pinnatifid apex (fig. b); 11115 would be
an impossible thing, if Dr. CHRIST was right.

The genus is probably monotypic with the single species:

Sei-pyllopsis· eaespitosa (Gaud.) comb. nov.

A very variable species, but 1 have found it impossible
to distinguish the following forms specifically. The differen—
ces between them are evidently due to cxternal conditions.
The spec-iniens from the alpine region of Fuegia and those
from the humid forests 01 Gna-itecas look very different in
habit, but they show the same essential characters.
