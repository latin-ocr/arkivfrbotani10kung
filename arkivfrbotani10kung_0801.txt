HALLE, FRUCTIFICATIONS OF CLADOPHLEBIS DENTICULATA. 3

specimens of a Cladophlebis described by ΜΟΒΒΙΞ1 as Pecolneris
australis and identified by several authors with the very closely
allied Claclophlebis denticulata BRGN. sp. On the ground of the
structure and arrangement of the sporangia, the species is placed
in the recent genus Talea..

The very great resemblance, in the outward characters of
the sterile fronds, between the Australian form and the Euro-
pean Cladophlebis denticulata leads to the idea that at least
some of the fronds referred to the latter provisional species might
also be of Osmundaceous affinities. The fructification of the
European Clacloplelebis denticulata is, however, comparatively
unknown. It is generally held (cfr saw-Am), 1000), that the fern
described by W. C. NVILLIAMSON in the Fossil Flora of LINDLEY
and HUTTON (pl. 120) as Pccopteris undans represents the fertile
frond of Cladophlebis denticulata. W'lLLIAMSON, in his description
of the species, states that one sorus is placed opposite to the een-
tre of each indentation of the edges of the segments, and that
one branch of 1110 seeondary veins always passes through each
sorus. In the fig. O of pl. 120 of LINDLEY & HUTTON there arc
seen what appear to be sporangia, placed in one row on each side
of the seeondary veins which arc represented as simple. This,
the type-specimen of Pecopteris undans, differs from the typical
Cladophlebis denticulata in the very deeply undulated margin.

Later, SEWARD and S. O. FORD² figured a fertile leaf which
is referred 10 Clmlophlebts denticulata. The specimen is stated
to bear resemblance to fertile segments of Todea bar-barm· but
as the structure of 1110 sporangia is not known, no definite classi-
fieation is attempted. The probability of an Osmundaceous
affinity is emphasized, however, in contrast with the doubtful
attribution previously made of a similar specimen to the Poly-
pocliaceoe. 111 1110 second volume of his Fossil Plants (p. 343,
fig. 258), Sam-mn also places Claclophlebis denticulata under 1110
Osm ι( mlaceoe.

It is this just mentioned specimen of SEwARD and FORD,
which I have had an opportunity to study in Stoekholm. 1
ought to mention that Prof. NATflORST, when he examined this
specimen in Cambridge, as shown by his drawings, arrived at
