Helcchos de Juan Fernandez 34—2 A. capenee Johow, l.

Juan Fernandez: Masatierra, Valle Colonial, 22. 8. 1908.

The two leaves collected are somewhat different in gen-
cra] habit, but are certainly forms of the same species. The one.
which is sterile, has a short, compact lamina with triangular-
ovate‚ shortly acuminate pinnae and pinnules‚ which are so
closely placed, that they covers each another3 the other leaf,
which is fertile, has an open lamina with pinnae at distances
of 5-6 cm.; pinnules distant, narrow obcuneate, i. e. from
a broader base very gradually attenuated in an acuminate
apex. This latter form resembles very much some forms of
the variable P. adiantv'jorme (Forst.) J. Sm. (Aspidiwm ca-
pense Willd.>, and I am very inclined to believe this form being
the same JOHOW named A. carpeuse. Ι have compared the
two specimens with numerous samples of P. adiantiforme
from various countries and find, that P. Berterianum can be
distinguished from all forms of P. adiantijorme by 1) the
scales of the rhizome‚ which are narrow-acuminate‚ ofadeep
redbrown colour or almost black, hard and thick, while in
P. adiantisorme the scales are broadly ovate, yellowish brown,
very thin3 2) the rather densely scaly under surface, 3) the
exactly opposite pinnae and 4) the distinctly decurrent pin·
nules. Further I find in both specimens a peculiar charac-
ter, which seems to be unknown within the genus Polystichum,
namely the presence on both surfaces of numerous, somewhat
irregularly shaped, rather flat, a little ις11111111ἕ, brown drops
of gum. By microscopical analysis the gum is found to be
a secrete from very small, capitate, unicellular glands, which
are partly immersed between the cells of the epidermis. I
have examined a long series of species of Polystz'chwm„ but
in all the surfaces of the lamina were found to be quite with-
out glands.
