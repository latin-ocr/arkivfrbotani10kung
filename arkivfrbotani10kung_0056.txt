28. 8. 1908. Α new locality for the species. The specimens
collected are large (lamina 30><10 cm.) and agree exactly
with MILDE's description of the variety, which is found in
America from Chile along the Andes to Mexico.

Blechnum.

The southern temperate zone is especially rich in species
of this genus, and several occur also in South America,
where they vary considerably. By determining species of
Blecmmn we lack unfortunately a monograph of the genus,
as the treatment in Syn. Fil. is very unsatisfactory, because
the authors put together in a single species forms from the
most remote regions. Such »species» as Lomarz’a attenuata,
L. capensfs and L. tabularis of Syn. Fil. are good examples
of this kind of treatment. It would be to desire that a pte-
ridologist should take up the genus for monographic study.

Blechuum penna marina (Poir.) KUHN.

Ι can distinguish three forms of this well-known species,

the type of which is unknown to me.

1. Α small reduced form: sterile leaf 5-7 cm. long, inclu-
ding the dark-brown stipe, which is shorter than the
lamina, 2-3 cm. long. Lamina downwards abruptly
narrowed or shortly attenuat'ed3 lower segments rarely
free. Costa greenish or even stramineous.
