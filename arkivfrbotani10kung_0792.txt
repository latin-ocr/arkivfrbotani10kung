ones. Some small, scale-like fronds from the J urassio of Oregon
have been hesitatingly referred by F ONTAINE to W illiamsonia
and are described by VVARD¹ as »Bracts of Willicz-msonia? No. 2. »
These »bracts ›> look very like the Yorkshire fossils, but are de-
scribed as thick and fleshy. N either in the case of the American
specimens is there any evidence that they have belonged to an
inflorescence. They may be of the nature of scale-fronds or
stipules, but the other possibility certainly deserves to be con-
sidered too.

The genus Cycadolepis, instituted by ΞΑΡΟΒΤΑ,2 has been
extended by SEWARD³ so as to include different kinds of scale-
like leaf-structures of cycadean plants. Of forms referred by
SEWARD to this genus there are some specimens of C. Jenkin-
είαηα (TATE) from the Uitenhage formation of South Africa,⁴
which present a certain resemblance to the Yorkshire fossils.
This is especially the case with the specimen in SEWARD’S pl. 4,
fig. 6, which shows a distinct venation similar to that of the
Yorkshire form in pl. 2, fig. 1, of the present paper. SEWARD
notes the thinner and more leaf-like appearance of these fossils
as compared with the specimens of Cycadolepis from the VVeal-
den strata of England. The objects are considered as protective
scale-leaves, possibly borne on cycadean stems, although it is
admitted that similar structures do not occur in existing oycads.
A comparison is also made with the sheathing stipules of certain
recent ferns such as sslarattia, Anqiopterz's and Todea. I am in-
clined to think, however, that C'ycaclolepz's J enlcinsiana, like ,
the similar Yorkshire fossils, might be considered, with equal
probability, as belonging to the floral apparatus of some highly
developed gymnosperm, perhaps of Bennettitean affinities. The
possibility appears at least worthy of consideration.

With the scale-like leaves described above may possibly
be compared a fragment recently described by SEWARD5 from
the Jurassic of Scotland. This fragment is mentionded as an
