THORE G. HALLE, CLOUGHTONIA, A PROBLEMATIC FOSSIL PLANT 5

Aphlebia and considered as possibly a stipule-like organ of 3
fern, being comparable with the stipules of Anqiopteris evecta.
The resemblance shown by this same specimen, on the other
hand, to the Yorkshire fossils readily suggests a comparison of
the latter with similar stipular organs of ferns of marattiaceous
affinities. ’Q The Botanical Department- of the State Museum of
Natural History at Stockholm possessed no stipules of M arania
or Anqiopteris; but, through the courtesy of Geh. Ober—R-egie-
rungsrat Prof. A. ENGLER in Berlin> Colonel D. PRAIN in Kew
and Prof. WAmnNG in Copenhagen, Professor NATHORST has been
able to obtain for the Museum a very complete collection of
such structures. Of these, only the membranaceous stipules
of Anqiopterio· evecta* 11631, 35 SEWARD has stated, a certain re-
semblance to the A [111Ιεῦιά of Sutherland. The structures named
here Clouqletonia ruqosa are very different and, probably,
cannot be interpreted as feru-stipules at all. The 111111, 1116111-
branaceous texture is different from anything in the way of sti-
pules among recent Marattiales. The regular shape of the la—
mina with its protracted petiolar 113531 11311, and the definitely
marked margin of the tapering and pointed distal end, are not
characters typical of feru-stipules. Aphlebia cannot therefore
be considered as an appropriate designation for these fossils.
Still less can they be referred, as has been done in a similar 6356
by FONTAINE, to Williamsonia, there being not the slightest
evidence of a connection with such flowers. Although 1116 6105-
651 resemblance is borne by the Yorkshire leaves to some of
SEWARD'S speeimens of Cycaclolepis from South Africa, it does
not appear justifiable to include them in the latter genus. It
is not certain that the present fossils are scales at all; far less
is there any reason to regard them as scale-leaves of cycads,
especially as thcrc 316 110 similar structures known among living
representatives of that class. Ι have preferred, therefore, to
1156 a non-committing provisional name, while expecting that
better material will enable us to establish a 111016 accurate classi-
fication. At present it is impossible to form a definite opinion
even 35 10 1116 morphological nature of these fossils. The scope
of the present notes is merely to draw attention to these struet-
ures and to the possibility that they may belong to the floral
apparatus of the highest gymnosperms and perhaps in some
respect foreshadow the petals of the angiosperms.
