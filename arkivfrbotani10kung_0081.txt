This variety looks very distinct, but its very slender
rhizome and stipe and peculial· habit are evidently due to
its growing—place between dense masses of mosses (Poly-
trie-hum). It is connected with the type by some forms of
var. elon9ala. Dr. CHRIST’S description agrees badly with
our plant, which, however, is exactly the same form as the
type-specimen of H. chsenii in Naturh. Riksmuseum.
